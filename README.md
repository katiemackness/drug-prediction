# Drug Prediction

## Overview

This project compares different machine learning algorithms to determine the best recommendation for a drug for patients. By leveraging various models, we aim to optimize the prediction process and provide data-driven insights into drug prescriptions.

## Features

- **Multiple ML Algorithms:** Comparison of different approaches to enhance drug recommendation accuracy.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Statistical analysis and visualizations to interpret results.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics and comparisons to assess algorithm effectiveness.

## Usage
- Modify data inputs as required.
- Run experiments with different machine learning models.
- Evaluate results through performance metrics.

## Contributing
